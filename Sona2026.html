<h1>President Mutharika Outlines Bold Economic and Social Reforms in 2026 SONA</h1>

<p><strong>Lilongwe —</strong> In a packed session at the Parliament Building on Friday, <strong>President Arthur Peter Mutharika</strong> delivered the 2026 State of the Nation Address (SONA), setting out a comprehensive agenda aimed at steering Malawi out of persistent economic challenges and onto a path of sustainable growth.</p>

<p>The President acknowledged the severe economic crisis, including food insecurity, foreign exchange shortages, and high inflation — conditions that severely impacted households nationwide.</p>

<p>“We found a broken economy, and we acted swiftly,” Mutharika told Parliament, noting that inflation — once nearing 29% — is now projected to fall below 21% this year.</p>

<p>A major highlight was the focus on <strong>food security</strong>, with maize prices dropping after government interventions. The President reiterated: <em>“No Malawian should die of hunger.”</em></p>

<p>Other plans included doubling national fuel storage, expanding electricity generation, strengthening industrial zones, overhauling mining policy, and investing in roads and markets. Public sector reforms and anti-corruption measures were also emphasized.</p>

<p>Reactions to the address have been mixed, but today’s SONA has set the tone for what the President described as a <strong>decisive era of recovery and national transformation</strong>.</p>
